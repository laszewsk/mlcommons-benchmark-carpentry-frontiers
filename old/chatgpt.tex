% CHATGPT

After discussion with others we decided to keep for now these two tables out. Mayeb in a future version we put it back in.

Reaosning: instead seeing what we forgot it may actually evaluate what chatgpt can and can not do, which is not the point at this time to evaluate.

Moved: Most recently, we have seen a number of benchmarking efforts arise that focus on AI-specific tasks. When asking ChatGPT this includes  (a) HPC AI500\TODO{\cite{???}} / HPC AI500 v2\TODO{\cite{???}}: which measures deep learning tasks (e.g. ResNet, Faster RCNN) at scale, focusing on both accuracy and throughput \cite{milabench,www-aibench} (b) MLPerf HPC, which evaluates scientific ML on HPC, measuring memory, I/O, compute, and communication interplay \cite{mlperf}. This even includes community-based benchmarks that address scientific problems bounty incentivized to provide the most accurate solution for a particular problem, such as popularized by Kaggle. \cite{www-kaggle}

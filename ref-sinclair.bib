                  chip which packs together 354 independent
                  processors, resulting in 362 TFLOPS of compute and

  abstract =	 {Each new generation of GPUs vastly increases the
                  resources available to GPGPU programs.  GPU
                  programming models (like CUDA) were designed to
                  scale to use these resources.  However, we find that
                  CUDA programs actually do not scale to utilize all
                  available resources, with over 30\% of resources
                  going unused on average for programs of the Parboil2
                  suite that we used in our work. Current GPUs
                  therefore allow concurrent execution of kernels to
                  improve utilization. In this work, we study
                  concurrent execution of GPU kernels using
                  multiprogram workloads on current NVIDIA Fermi
                  GPUs. On two-program workloads from the Parboil2
                  benchmark suite we find concurrent execution is
                  often no better than serialized execution. We
                  identify that the lack of control over resource
                  allocation to kernels is a major serialization
                  bottleneck. We propose transformations that convert
                  CUDA kernels into elastic kernels which permit
                  fine-grained control over their resource usage. We
                  then propose several elastic-kernel aware
                  concurrency policies that offer significantly better
                  performance and concurrency compared to the current
                  CUDA policy. We evaluate our proposals on real
                  hardware using multiprogrammed workloads constructed
                  from benchmarks in the Parboil 2 suite. On average,
                  our proposals increase system throughput (STP) by
                  1.21x and improve the average normalized turnaround
                  time (ANTT) by 3.73x for two-program workloads when
                  compared to the current CUDA concurrency
                  implementation.},

  abstract =	 {The dominant sequence transduction models are based
                  on complex recurrent or convolutional neural
                  networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The
                  best performing models also connect the encoder and
                  decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a
                  new simple network architecture, the Transformer,
                  based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing
                  with recurrence and convolutions
                  entirely. Experiments on two machine translation
                  tasks show these models to be superior in quality
                  while being more parallelizable and requiring
                  significantly less time to train. Our model achieves
                  28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German
                  translation task, improving over the existing best
                  results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the
                  WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our
                  model establishes a new single-model
                  state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training
                  for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the
                  training costs of the best models from the
                  literature.},

  abstract =	 {Current state-of-the-art in GPU networking advocates
                  a host-centric model that reduces performance and
                  increases code complexity. Recently, researchers
                  have explored several techniques for networking
                  within a GPU kernel itself. These approaches,
                  however, suffer from high latency, waste energy on
                  the host, and are not scalable with larger/more GPUs
                  on a node. In this work, we introduce Command
                  Processor Networking (ComP-Net), which leverages the
                  availability of scalar cores integrated on the GPU
                  itself to provide high-performance intra-kernel
                  networking. ComP-Net enables efficient
                  synchronization between the Command Processors and
                  Compute Units on the GPU through a line locking
                  scheme implemented in the GPU's shared last-level
                  cache. We illustrate that ComP-Net can improve
                  application performance by up to 20\% and provide up
                  to 50\% reduction in energy consumption
                  vs. competing networking techniques across a Jacobi
                  stencil, allreduce collective, and machine learning
                  applications.},

  abstract =	 {Personalized recommendation systems leverage deep
                  learning models and account for the majority of data
                  center AI cycles. Their performance is dominated by
                  memory-bound sparse embedding operations with unique
                  irregular memory access patterns that pose a
                  fundamental challenge to accelerate. This paper
                  proposes a lightweight, commodity DRAM compliant,
                  near-memory processing solution to accelerate
                  personalized recommendation inference. The in-depth
                  characterization of production-grade recommendation
                  models shows that embedding operations with high
                  model-, operator- and data-level parallelism lead to
                  memory bandwidth saturation, limiting recommendation
                  inference performance.  We propose RecNMP which
                  provides a scalable solution to improve system
                  throughput, supporting a broad range of sparse
                  embedding models. RecNMP is specifically tailored to
                  production environments with heavy co-location of
                  operators on a single server.  Several
                  hardware/software co-optimization techniques such as
                  memory-side caching, table-aware packet scheduling,
                  and hot entry profiling are studied, providing up to
                  9.8x memory latency speedup over a highly-optimized
                  baseline. Overall, RecNMP offers 4.2x throughput
                  improvement and 45.8\% memory energy savings.},

  abstract =	 {A key challenge in next-generation supercomputing is
                  to effectively schedule limited power
                  resources. Modern processors suffer from
                  increasingly large power variations due to the chip
                  manufacturing process. These variations lead to
                  power inhomogeneity in current systems and manifest
                  into performance inhomogeneity in power constrained
                  environments, drastically limiting supercomputing
                  performance. We present a first-of-its-kind study on
                  manufacturing variability on four production HPC
                  systems spanning four microarchitectures, analyze
                  its impact on HPC applications, and propose a novel
                  variation-aware power budgeting scheme to maximize
                  effective application performance. Our low-cost and
                  scalable budgeting algorithm strives to achieve
                  performance homogeneity under a power constraint by
                  deriving application-specific, module-level power
                  allocations. Experimental results using a 1,920
                  socket system show up to 5.4X speedup, with an
                  average speedup of 1.8X across all benchmarks when
                  compared to a variation-unaware power allocation
                  scheme.},

  abstract =	 {Given the highly empirical nature of research in
                  cloud computing, networked systems, and related
                  fields, testbeds play an important role in the
                  research ecosystem. In this paper, we cover one such
                  facility, CloudLab, which supports systems research
                  by providing raw access to programmable hardware,
                  enabling research at large scales, and creating a
                  shared platform for repeatable research.We present
                  our experiences designing CloudLab and operating it
                  for four years, serving nearly 4,000 users who have
                  run over 79,000 experiments on 2,250 servers,
                  switches, and other pieces of datacenter
                  equipment. From this experience, we draw lessons
                  organized around two themes. The first set comes
                  from analysis of data regarding the use of CloudLab:
                  how users interact with it, what they use it for,
                  and the implications for facility design and
                  operation. Our second set of lessons comes from
                  looking at the ways that algorithms used "under the
                  hood," such as resource allocation, have important--
                  and sometimes unexpected--effects on user experience
                  and behavior. These lessons can be of value to the
                  designers and operators of IaaS facilities in
                  general, systems testbeds in particular, and users
                  who have a stake in understanding how these systems
                  are built.},

  abstract =	 {Modern CPUs suffer from performance and power
                  consumption variability due to the manufacturing
                  process. As a result, systems that do not consider
                  such variability caused by manufacturing issues lead
                  to performance degradations and wasted power. In
                  order to avoid such negative impact, users and
                  system administrators must actively counteract any
                  manufacturing variability.In this work we show that
                  parallel systems benefit from taking into account
                  the consequences of manufacturing variability when
                  making scheduling decisions at the job scheduler
                  level. We also show that it is possible to predict
                  the impact of this variability on specific
                  applications by using variability-aware power
                  prediction models. Based on these power models, we
                  propose two job scheduling policies that consider
                  the effects of manufacturing variability for each
                  application and that ensure that power consumption
                  stays under a system-wide power budget. We evaluate
                  our policies under different power budgets and
                  traffic scenarios, consisting of both single- and
                  multi-node parallel applications, utilizing up to
                  4096 cores in total. We demonstrate that they
                  decrease job turnaround time, compared to
                  contemporary scheduling policies used on production
                  clusters, up to 31\% while saving up to 5.5\%
                  energy.},

  abstract =	 {As GPUs have become more programmable, their
                  performance and energy benefits have made them
                  increasingly popular. However, while GPU compute
                  units continue to improve in performance, on-chip
                  memories lag behind and data accesses are becoming
                  increasingly expensive in performance and
                  energy. Emerging GPU coherence protocols can
                  mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting data reuse in
                  GPU caches across kernel boundaries. Unfortunately,
                  current GPU thread block schedulers are typically
                  not designed to expose such reuse. This article
                  proposes new hardware thread block schedulers that
                  optimize inter-kernel reuse while using work
                  stealing to preserve load balance. Our schedulers
                  are simple, decentralized, and have extremely low
                  overhead. Compared to a baseline round-robin
                  scheduler, the best performing scheduler reduces
                  average execution time and energy by 19\% and 11\%,
                  respectively, in regular applications, and 10\% and
                  8\%, respectively, in irregular applications.},

                  supercomputers can be accelerated by improving the
                  quality and comparability of efficiency
                  measurements. The ability to generate accurate
                  measurements at extreme scale are just now
                  emerging. The realization of system-level
                  measurement capabilities can be accelerated with a
                  commonly adopted and high quality measurement
                  methodology for use while running a workload,
                  typically a benchmark. This paper describes a
                  methodology that has been developed collaboratively
                  through the Energy Efficient HPC Working Group to
                  support architectural analysis and comparative
                  measurements for rankings, such as the Top500 and
                  Green500. To support measurements with varying
                  amounts of effort and equipment required we present
                  three distinct levels of measurement, which provide
                  increasing levels of accuracy. Level 1 is similar to
                  the Green500 run rules today, a single average power
                  measurement extrapolated from a subset of a
                  machine. Level 2 is more comprehensive, but still
                  widely achievable. Level 3 is the most rigorous of
                  the three methodologies but is only possible at a
                  few sites. However, the Level 3 methodology
                  generates a high quality result that exposes details
                  that the other methodologies may miss. In addition,
                  we present case studies from the Leibniz
                  Supercomputing Centre (LRZ), Argonne National
                  Laboratory (ANL) and Calcul Qu\'{e}bec
                  Universit\'{e} Laval that explore the benefits and
                  difficulties of gathering high quality, system-level

  abstract =	 {Since 2005, processor designers have increased core
                  counts to exploit Moore's Law scaling, rather than
                  focusing on single-core performance. The failure of
                  Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore
                  parts is partially a response, may soon limit
                  multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has
                  been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling
                  limits by combining device scaling, single-core
                  scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the
                  speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads
                  for the next five technology generations. For device
                  scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set
                  of more conservative device scaling parameters. To
                  model single-core scaling, we combine measurements
                  from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal
                  frontiers for area/performance and
                  power/performance. Finally, to model multicore
                  scaling, we build a detailed performance model of
                  upper-bound performance and lower-bound core
                  power. The multicore designs we study include
                  single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded
                  GPU-like multicore chip organizations with
                  symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed
                  topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip
                  organization and topology, multicore scaling is
                  power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by
                  the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one
                  year from now), 21\% of a fixed-size chip must be
                  powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more
                  than 50\%. Through 2024, only 7.9x average speedup
                  is possible across commonly used parallel workloads,
                  leaving a nearly 24-fold gap from a target of
                  doubled performance per generation.},

  abstract =	 {The last decade has seen power consumption move from
                  an afterthought to the foremost design constraint of
                  new supercomputers. Measuring the power of a
                  supercomputer can be a daunting proposition, and as
                  a result, many published measurements are
                  extrapolated. This paper explores the validity of
                  these extrapolations in the context of inter-node
                  power variability and power variations over time
                  within a run. We characterize power variability
                  across nodes in systems at eight supercomputer
                  centers across the globe. This characterization
                  shows that the current requirement for measurements
                  submitted to the Green500 and others is
                  insufficient, allowing variations of up to 20\% due
                  to measurement timing and a further 10--15\% due to
                  insufficient sample sizes. This paper proposes new
                  power and energy measurement requirements for
                  supercomputers, some of which have been accepted for
                  use by the Green500 and Top500, to ensure consistent

                  analytical model of performance in the face of
                  changing frequency in a GPGPU. It shows that prior
                  models not targeted at a GPGPU fail to account for
                  important characteristics of GPGPU execution,
                  including the high degree of overlap between memory
                  access and computation and the frequency of

                  greater accuracy than prior runtime performance
                  models, being within 4\% on average when scaling
                  frequency by up to 7X. Using CRISP to drive a

  abstract =	 {Nowadays, GPUs are widely used to accelerate many
                  high performance computing applications. Energy
                  conservation of such computing systems has become an
                  important research topic. Dynamic voltage/frequency
                  scaling (DVFS) is proved to be an appealing method
                  for saving energy for traditional computing
                  centers. However, there is still a lack of firsthand
                  study on the effectiveness of GPU DVFS. This paper
                  presents a thorough measurement study that aims to
                  explore how GPU DVFS affects the system energy
                  consumption. We conduct experiments on a real GPU
                  platform with 37 benchmark applications. Our results
                  show that GPU voltage/frequency scaling is an
                  effective approach to conserving energy. For
                  example, by scaling down the GPU core voltage and
                  frequency, we have achieved an average of 19.28\%
                  energy reduction compared with the default setting,
                  while giving up no more than 4\% of performance. For
                  all tested GPU applications, core voltage scaling is
                  significantly effective to reduce system energy
                  consumption. Meanwhile the effects of scaling core
                  frequency and memory frequency depend on the
                  characteristics of GPU applications.},

                  increasingly popular for compute workloads, mainly
                  because of their large number of processing elements
                  and high-bandwidth to off-chip memory. The roofline
                  model captures the ratio between the two (the

                  improving the computing power of general-purpose
                  graphics processing units (GPGPUs), which
                  facilitates the prosperity of deep neural networks
                  (DNNs) in multiple fields like computer vision and
                  natural language processing. A typical DNN training
                  process repeatedly updates tens of millions of
                  parameters, which not only requires huge computing
                  resources but also consumes significant energy. In
                  order to train DNNs in a more energy-efficient way,
                  we empirically investigate the impact of GPU Dynamic
                  Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) on the energy

                  settings of three tested GPUs, the optimal core
                  frequency can help conserve 8.7\%~23.1\% energy
                  consumption for different DNN training
                  cases. Regarding the inference, the benefits vary

                  performance within a power budget often involves
                  dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). Thus,
                  accurately predicting the power consumption of an
                  application at different DVFS levels (or more
                  generally, different processor configurations) is
                  paramount for the energy-efficient functioning of a
                  high-performance computing (HPC) system. The

                  libraries that allow the programmer to change both
                  memory and core frequencies. The possibility to
                  manually set these frequencies is a great
                  opportunity for application tuning, which can focus
                  on the best application-dependent setting. However,
                  this task is not straightforward because of the
                  large set of possible configurations and because of
                  the multi-objective nature of the problem, which
                  minimizes energy consumption and maximizes
                  performance.This paper proposes a method to predict
                  the best core and memory frequency configurations on
                  GPUs for an input OpenCL kernel. Our modeling
                  approach, based on machine learning, first predicts
                  speedup and normalized energy over the default
                  frequency configuration. Then, it combines the two
                  models into a multi-objective one that predicts a
                  Pareto-set of frequency configurations. The approach
                  uses static code features, is built on a set of
                  carefully designed micro-benchmarks, and can predict
                  the best frequency settings of a new kernel without
                  executing it. Test results show that our modeling
                  approach is very accurate on predicting extrema
                  points and Pareto set for ten out of twelve test
                  benchmarks, and discover frequency configurations
                  that dominate the default configuration in either

                  difference of up to 16\% among processors on the
                  Turbo Boost-enabled supercomputers: Edison, Cab,
                  Stampede. There is less than 1\% variation on Blue
                  Waters, which does not have a dynamic overcl\ ocking
                  feature. We analyze measurements from temperature
                  and power instrumentation and find that intrinsic
                  differences in the chips' power efficiency is the
                  culprit behind the frequency variation. Moreover, we
                  analyze potential solutions such as disabling Turbo
                  Boost, l\ eaving idle cores and replacing slow chips
                  to mitigate the variation. We also propose a
                  speed-aware dynamic task redistribution (load
                  balancing) algorithm to reduce the negative effects
                  of performance variation. Our speed-aware load
                  balancing algorithm improves the perf\ ormance up to
                  18\% compared to no load balancing performance and
                  6\% better than the non-speed aware counterpart.},

  abstract =	 {Simulating all threads in a scaled GPU workload
                  results in prohibitive simulation cost. Cycle-level
                  simulation is orders of magnitude slower than native
                  silicon, the only solution is to reduce the amount
                  of work simulated while accurately representing the
                  program. Existing solutions to simulate GPU programs
                  either scale the input size, simulate the first
                  several billion instructions, or simulate a portion
                  of both the GPU and the workload. These solutions
                  lack validation against scaled systems, produce
                  unrealistic contention conditions and frequently
                  miss critical code sections. Existing CPU sampling
                  mechanisms, like SimPoint, reduce per-thread
                  workload, and are ill-suited to GPU programs where
                  reducing the number of threads is critical. Sampling
                  solutions on GPUs space lack silicon validation,
                  require per-workload parameter tuning, and do not
                  scale. A tractable solution, validated on
                  contemporary scaled workloads, is needed to provide
                  credible simulation results. By studying scaled
                  workloads with centuries-long simulation times, we
                  uncover practical and algorithmic limitations of
                  existing solutions and propose Principal Kernel
                  Analysis: a hierarchical program sampling
                  methodology that concisely represents GPU programs
                  by selecting representative kernel portions using a
                  scalable profiling methodology, tractable clustering
                  algorithm and detection of intra-kernel IPC
                  stability. We validate Principal Kernel Analysis
                  across 147 workloads and three GPU generations using
                  the Accel-Sim simulator, demonstrating a better
                  performance/error tradeoff than prior work and that
                  century-long MLPerf simulations are reduced to hours
                  with an average cycle error of 27\% versus silicon.},

  abstract =	 {With widespread advances in machine learning, a
                  number of large enterprises are beginning to
                  incorporate machine learning models across a number
                  of products. These models are typically trained on
                  shared, multi-tenant GPU clusters. Similar to
                  existing cluster computing workloads, scheduling
                  frameworks aim to provide features like high
                  efficiency, resource isolation, fair sharing across
                  users, etc. However Deep Neural Network (DNN) based
                  workloads, predominantly trained on GPUs, differ in
                  two significant ways from traditional big data
                  analytics workloads. First, from a cluster
                  utilization perspective, GPUs represent a monolithic
                  resource that cannot be shared at a fine granularity
                  across users. Second, from a workload perspective,
                  deep learning frameworks require gang scheduling
                  reducing the flexibility of scheduling and making
                  the jobs themselves inelastic to failures at
                  runtime. In this paper we present a detailed
                  workload characterization of a two-month long trace
                  from a multi-tenant GPU cluster in Microsoft. By
                  correlating scheduler logs with logs from individual
                  jobs, we study three distinct issues that affect
                  cluster utilization for DNN training workloads on
                  multi-tenant clusters: (1) the effect of gang
                  scheduling and locality constraints on queuing, (2)
                  the effect of locality on GPU utilization, and (3)
                  failures during training. Based on our experience
                  running a large-scale operation, we provide design
                  guidelines pertaining to next-generation cluster
                  schedulers for DNN training workloads.},

                  irregularity of data access and control flow, and
                  the complexity of programming GPUs, have presented
                  two significant challenges to developing a
                  programmable high-performance graph
                  library. “Gunrock,” our graph-processing system
                  designed specifically for the GPU, uses a
                  high-level, bulk-synchronous, data-centric
                  abstraction focused on operations on a vertex or
                  edge frontier. Gunrock achieves a balance between
                  performance and expressiveness by coupling
                  high-performance GPU computing primitives and
                  optimization strategies with a high-level
                  programming model that allows programmers to quickly
                  develop new graph primitives with small code size
                  and minimal GPU programming knowledge. We
                  characterize the performance of various optimization
                  strategies and evaluate Gunrock’s overall
                  performance on different GPU architectures on a wide
                  range of graph primitives that span from
                  traversal-based algorithms and ranking algorithms,
                  to triangle counting and bipartite-graph-based
                  algorithms. The results show that on a single GPU,
                  Gunrock has on average at least an order of
                  magnitude speedup over Boost and PowerGraph,
                  comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired
                  primitives and CPU shared-memory graph libraries,
                  such as Ligra and Galois, and better performance

  abstract =	 {The rapidly growing popularity and scale of
                  data-parallel workloads demand a corresponding
                  increase in raw computational power of Graphics
                  Processing Units (GPUs). As single-GPU platforms
                  struggle to satisfy these performance demands,
                  multi-GPU platforms have started to dominate the
                  high-performance computing world. The advent of such
                  systems raises a number of design challenges,
                  including the GPU microarchitecture, multi-GPU
                  interconnect fabric, runtime libraries, and
                  associated programming models. The research
                  community currently lacks a publicly available and
                  comprehensive multi-GPU simulation framework to
                  evaluate next-generation multi-GPU system designs.In
                  this work, we present MGPUSim, a cycle-accurate,
                  extensively validated, multi-GPU simulator, based on
                  AMD's Graphics Core Next 3 (GCN3) instruction set
                  architecture. MGPUSim comes with in-built support
                  for multi-threaded execution to enable fast,
                  parallelized, and accurate simulation.  In terms of
                  performance accuracy, MGPUSim differs by only 5.5%
                  on average from the actual GPU hardware. We also
                  achieve a 3.5\texttimes{} and a 2.5\texttimes{}
                  average speedup running functional emulation and
                  detailed timing simulation, respectively, on a
                  4-core CPU, while delivering the same accuracy as
                  serial simulation.We illustrate the flexibility and
                  capability of the simulator through two concrete
                  design studies. In the first, we propose the
                  Locality API, an API extension that allows the GPU
                  programmer to both avoid the complexity of multi-GPU
                  programming, while precisely controlling data
                  placement in the multi-GPU memory. In the second
                  design study, we propose Progressive Page Splitting
                  Migration (PASI), a customized multi-GPU memory
                  management system enabling the hardware to
                  progressively improve data placement. For a discrete
                  4-GPU system, we observe that the Locality API can
                  speed up the system by 1.6\texttimes{} (geometric
                  mean), and PASI can improve the system performance
                  by 2.6\texttimes{} (geometric mean) across all
                  benchmarks, compared to a unified 4-GPU platform.},

                  that boost performance but dissipate additional
                  power. We describe a sprinting architecture in which
                  many, independent chip multiprocessors share a power
                  supply and sprints are constrained by the chips'
                  thermal limits and the rack's power

                  sprinting game, a multi-agent perspective on
                  managing sprints. Strategic agents decide whether to
                  sprint based on application phases and system
                  conditions. The game produces an equilibrium that
                  improves task throughput for data analytics
                  workloads by 4-6\texttimes{} over prior greedy
                  heuristics and performs within 90\% of an upper

  abstract =	 {GPU has emerged as the go-to accelerator for HPC
                  workloads, however its power consumption has become
                  a major limiting factor for further scaling HPC
                  systems. An accurate understanding of GPU power
                  consumption is essential for further improving its
                  energy efficiency, and consequently reducing the
                  associated carbon footprint. Despite the limited
                  documentation and lack of understanding, NVIDIA
                  GPUs’ built-in power sensor is widely used in
                  energy-efficient computing research. Our study seeks
                  to elucidate the internal mechanisms of the power
                  readings provided by nvidia-smi and assess the
                  accuracy of the measurements. We evaluated over 70
                  different GPUs across 12 architectural generations,
                  and identified several unforeseen problems that can
                  lead to drastic under/overestimation of energy
                  consumed, for example on the A100 and H100 GPUs only
                  25% of the runtime is sampled. We proposed several
                  mitigations that could reduce the energy measurement
                  error by an average of 35% in the test cases we

  abstract =	 {With increasing clock frequencies and silicon
                  integration, power aware computing has become a
                  critical concern in the design of embedded
                  processors and systems-on-chip. One of the more
                  effective and widely used methods for power-aware
                  computing is dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). In order
                  to obtain the maximum power savings from DVS, it is
                  essential to scale the supply voltage as low as
                  possible while ensuring correct operation of the
                  processor. The critical voltage is chosen such that
                  under a worst-case scenario of process and
                  environmental variations, the processor always
                  operates correctly. However, this approach leads to
                  a very conservative supply voltage since such a
                  worst-case combination of different variabilities
                  will be very rare.In this talk, I detail a novel
                  approach to DVS, called Razor, based on dynamic
                  detection and correction of circuit timing
                  errors. The key idea of Razor is to tune the supply
                  voltage by monitoring the error rate during circuit
                  operation, thereby eliminating the need for voltage
                  margins and exploiting the data dependence of
                  circuit delay. A Razor flip-flop is introduced that
                  double-samples pipeline stage values, once with a
                  fast clock and again with a time-borrowing delayed
                  clock. A metastability tolerant comparator then
                  validates latch values sampled with the fast
                  clock. In the event of a timing error, a modified
                  pipeline mispeculation recovery mechanism restores
                  correct program state. A prototype Razor processor
                  will be described, along with physical
                  measurements.},

                  potential energy and force field and to perform
                  molecular dynamics. Potential applications of
                  DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended
                  systems and from metallic systems to chemically
                  bonded systems. DeePMD-kit is interfaced with
                  TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning
                  frameworks, making the training process highly
                  automatic and efficient. On the other end,
                  DeePMD-kit is interfaced with high-performance
                  classical molecular dynamics and quantum
                  (path-integral) molecular dynamics packages, i.e.,
                  LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus, upon
                  training, the potential energy and force field
                  models can be used to perform efficient molecular
                  simulations for different purposes. As an example of
                  the many potential applications of the package, we
                  use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential
                  energy and forces of a water model using data
                  obtained from density functional theory. We
                  demonstrate that the resulted molecular dynamics
                  model reproduces accurately the structural
                  information contained in the original model.

                  the significant compute power of high-performance
                  computing systems. In this paper, we analyze the
                  performance characteristics of the benchmarks from
                  the exploratory research project CANDLE (Cancer
                  Distributed Learning Environment) with a focus on
                  the hyperparameters epochs, batch sizes, and
                  learning rates. We present the parallel methodology
                  that uses the distributed deep learning framework
                  Horovod to parallelize the CANDLE benchmarks. We
                  then use scaling strategies for both epochs and
                  batch size with linear learning rate scaling to
                  investigate how they impact the execution time and
                  accuracy as well as the power, energy, and
                  scalability of the parallel CANDLE benchmarks under
                  conditions of strong scaling and weak scaling on the
                  IBM Power9 heterogeneous system Summit at Oak Ridge
                  National Laboratory and the Cray XC40 Theta at
                  Argonne National Laboratory. This study provides
                  insights into how to set the proper numbers of
                  epochs, batch sizes, and compute resources for these
                  benchmarks to preserve the high accuracy and to
                  reduce the execution time of the benchmarks. We
                  identify the data-loading performance bottleneck and
                  then improve the performance and energy for better
                  scalability. Results with the modified benchmarks on
                  Summit indicate up to 78.25\% in performance
                  improvement and up to 78\% in energy saving under
                  strong scaling on up to 384 GPUs, and up to 79.5\%
                  in performance improvement and up to 77.11\% in
                  energy saving under weak scaling on up to 3,072
                  GPUs. On Theta, we achieve up to 45.22\% performance
                  improvement and up to 41.78\% in energy saving under
                  strong scaling on up to 384 nodes. Moreover, the
                  modification dramatically reduces the broadcast
                  overhead.},

Currently, they HPC community lacks a unified toolset to evaluate these technologies and design for these challenges.To address this problem, a number of institutions have joined together to create the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST), an open, modular, parallel, multi-criteria, multi-scale simulation framework.

  abstract = {Efficient resource utilization is a critical yet challenging problem in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, particularly in GPU-accelerated workloads. GPUs have become indispensable in modern datacenters, powering applications in AI, scientific computing, and large-scale simulations, but their potential is often hindered by imbalances in resource allocation and utilization. These inefficiencies across GPUs and nodes can lead to significant performance degradation and energy wastage. While existing works analyze resource utilization at a coarse level, they often fail to capture the intricate temporal and spatial imbalances present in multi-node GPU jobs. In this work, we analyze GPU jobs executed on the Perlmutter supercomputer, a GPU-accelerated system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), using telemetry data from one month of operation in 2024. We identify inefficiencies in how resources are allocated and utilized across GPU nodes and GPUs within nodes. We propose novel methodologies to quantify these imbalances using refined metrics that capture both spatial and temporal variations in resource utilization. Our analysis reveals that GPU utilization is generally well-balanced temporally for most jobs, with no significant temporal imbalances observed. However, GPU memory utilization remains consistently low across many jobs, highlighting opportunities to optimize resource allocation and improve memory usage efficiency.},
